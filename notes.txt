Dont run aws configure with root previlages, it can't able to read
For some plugins in jenkins need to restart manually--> sudo systemctl restart jenkins
After running build, we need to delete the workspace for that build  (post --> always --> deleteDir() )
when is used whether the stage should run or not
package.json --> Contains dependencies and versions

Build Files --> Contains our project details, name, version, dependencies, description
---------------
Java --> maven --> pom.xml
Python --. pip --> requirements.txt
NodeJs --> npm --> package.json
DotNet --> Nuget --> project.json

node_modules: is useful to run our project successfully in backend

NodeJs build file ---> Node js code and node_modules --> then only we can zip to deploy
every version should have a seperate artifact/zip file / build file (All are same names)

// Variable can be accessed with in that stage only not in other stages
To use in all stages use -->environment

Git --> is used to store the code (Not zip / exe  / packages / artifact files)
Nexus --> To store the Artifact,  not for code --> It is aheavy things

Docker Image is a foolish --> It a simple memory application


nexus --> 8081 (Port)
Jenkins --> 8080


group id, artifact id , version --> Combination of these 3 we can Identify uniquely modules/artifact's in a project

group id --> com.expense (These are unique) as we expense.com
artifact id --> backend --> Our repository name
version --> 1.1.0
Combination of both (group id + artifact id)  is unique

Like GitHub how we are creating repository and pushing code
Similarly
In Nexus create repository and push artifact

In nexus --> Allow redeploy --> Only 1 version in 1 artifact 
http://44.193.16.140:8081/repository/backend/ --> PUSH repository to this artifact


rebuilder --> Plugin --> Again build if fail + takes same previous parameters

Nexus is not a tools it is a utility, here no AGENT unlike Sonar Qube

In Sonar Qube (TOOL) there is a AGENT to send details to Sonar Scanner --> Like Agent in feild and SI (Scanner)
